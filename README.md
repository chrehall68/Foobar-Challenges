# Foobar Challenges

Hi, I'm Eliot Hall, current student at Independence High School.

Halfway through my google foobar challenge, I decided that it would be useful
if I could store my past projects for future reference. So, this repo was born.
The purpose of this repo is really just to hold my solutions and showcase my work.
